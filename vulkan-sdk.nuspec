This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

    <summary>The SDK for developing Vulkan applications</summary>
    <description>
      The SDK provides the development and runtime components for building, running, and debugging Vulkan applications.

      This comprehensive SDK includes the Vulkan loader, Vulkan layers, debugging tools, SPIR‐V tools, the Vulkan run time installer, documentation, samples, and demos.
      
      A thorough Vulkan Tutorial is also included to step you through the process of creating a simple Vulkan application, learning the basics of Vulkan along the way.

        ## Released 11/4/2019

        LunarG has released new Vulkan SDKs for Windows, Linux, and macOS based on the 1.1.126.0 header. This release includes maintenance updates and the latest extensions.
        
        ## Overview of new additions to Vulkan SDK 1.1.126.0
        
        - Improved validation layer coverage and bug fixes
        
        - Since the release of SDK 1.1.121.0, the following extensions have been added to the Vulkan spec and may be supported by a Vulkan device:
        
          * VK_KHR_spirv_1_4
        
          * VK_KHR_shader_clock
        
          * VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore
        
          * VK_KHR_shader_subgroup_extended_types
        
          * VK_GOOGLE_user_type
        
          * VK_IMG_format_pvrtc
        
        ## Reminder
        
        The VK_LUNARG_assistant_layer has been removed. This functionality has moved to the VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation as a new object (VK_VALIDATION_FEATURE_ENABLE_BEST_PRACTICES_EXT). Refer to the Best Practices documentation.
